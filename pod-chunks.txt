  Why Linux?

  An alternative to Windows/Mac computers

  Hypothesis


  Young people interested in careers involved with science, mathematics,
engineering, or almost any technical field should be introduced to

  Linux
  .

  What is Linux?

  Part 1


  More formally known as 
  GNU/Linux
   ,
it's a free operating system (OS) invented by Linus Torvald to
provide a UNIX-like system with all the standard
command-line and graphical tools that accompany
such a system.


  Linux
  , rather than Windows or Mac, provides much of the

  behind-the-scenes cloud
   computing in data centers and
*high-performance computing facilities. It also powers the Android and

  the Internet of Things
  * (IoT).

  What is Linux?

  Part 3


  The command-line environment provides the user with almost complete
freedom to automate tasks typical in research or other work or study
in technical fields.


  Linux
   also gives the user much greater control over what happens
and what does not happen on his or her computer.

  Linux vs. Windows: Windows


  Windows:


  Is everywhere


  Is primarily a GUI operation


  Is expensive


  Hides internals
  


  Has a non-case-sensitive file system
  


  Updates when Microsoft says it should, often restarting your
computer without your permission.

  Linux vs. Windows: Linux


  Linux:


  Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects


  Is everywhere, although it is usually working behind the scenes


  Has both GUI and intrinsic command line capabilities


  Is FREE
  


  Shows as much or as little of the internals as you want to see


  Has a case-sensitive file system


  Performs upgrades only if you want it to
  


  Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
"programmable calculator"

  Linux: How to get it


  On Windows or Mac:


  Use 
  Putty
   to connect to a cloud server (as cheap as $2.50 per month)


  Install the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem


  Use a live, bootable USB [recommended for intro]


  Use a live, bootable CD/DVD [only as a last resort]

  Linux: How to get it


  Install Linux as a VM guest on Windows 10 Pro Hyper-V


  Install VirtualBox to run a Linux Virtual Machine


  Use 
  Cygwin
   on Windows


  Best:


  Use a dual-boot, native installation


  Use Hyper-V on Windows 10 Pro


  Use a dedicated GNU/Linux PC or laptop

  Linux comes in many "flavors"


  A Linux system comes packaged in many 
  distributions
   such as
Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others.


  See 
  https://distrowatch.com
   for lots of information about
popularity, download statistics, and other stats on hundreds of

  distros
  .


  My Linux friends think 
  Linux Mint
   is one of the best 
  distros
   for beginners. I
prefer 
  Debian
   and have used it for over ten years

  Linux help?


  There is practically an infinite amount of Linux resources to be found
on the Internet.


  My group, the Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG), meets
monthly, and we have an installation meeting (by appointment only) on
the third Monday of every month.
