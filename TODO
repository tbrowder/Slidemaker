Use Pod::TreeWalker and RakuDoc::Utils
  to handle slide chunks

New tack:
  + use my simple first step to extract individual
    pod chunks for each slide
  + then unpack the pod manually and place it on the
    page
  + note the same tack could work for PDF::Letter

Now using 'Pod::To::PDF::Lite' to gen the basic PDF slides
  + in the interim, consider possibility of using
      a non-standard =slide format
      without a formal pod component

  + undocumented: use the :$style option 
      define a new Style class object, and set the params
        you want the single page will use it

  + need to be able to tweak the output via 
    the module's 'writer' method
    - perhaps add special :config key/value
    - if David is willing, help define Config values that will
      affect a pod chunk's affect on the $page
  + try:
    - after intial conversion, go through all pages
      and put the title in a blue box, rewrite title
      (and subtitle) and overlay them in white in the
      box
    - try to set change font and size on the generated
      pages

Use 'Rakuast::RakuDoc::Render' parsing to begin
rudimentary generation of simple slides, letters, and articles.

Use the following as test beds and use soonish:

slides: Why Linux
letter: Hancock

Parse with parser used with Coke's text test.
