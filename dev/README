The file "orig/why-linux.md" is the source
of the old process to create a pdf file.

It was hand-translated to an updates Softmaker version
on 'bigtom'.

Use Patrick's module to do the pod breakdown and rendering
before tweaking it for Slidemaker.

The general overview is this:

+ Break up the input pod to slides by '=slide' block entries
+ Create a class Slide for the '=slide' blocks
+ The result should be a list of Slide objects
+ Convert each Slide object to a PDF page
+ The end result will be a PDF doc with one page per slide
