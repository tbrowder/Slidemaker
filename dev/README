The file "orig/why-linux.md" is the source
of the old process to create a pdf file.

It was hand-translated to an updated Softmaker version
on 'bigtom'.

Use Patrick's module (Pod::To::Anything) to do the pod breakdown and rendering
before tweaking it for Slidemaker.

The general overview is this:

+ Define a slide deck configuration scheme in pod format
  - ensure it uses standard pod to the extent possible
    and it's expandable

+ Define a suitable set of pod entries to describe a simple
  slide's contents

+ Break up the input pod to slides by '=slide' block entries

+ Create a class Slide for the '=slide' blocks
+ The result should be a list of Slide objects
+ Convert each Slide object to a PDF page
+ The end result will be a PDF doc with one page per slide
