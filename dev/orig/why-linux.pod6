=begin head2
Hypothesis
=end head2

=begin para
Young people interested in careers involved with science, mathematics,
engineering, or almost any technical field should be introduced to
B<Linux> .
=end para

=begin head2
What is Linux?
=end head2

=begin para
More formally known as B<GNU/Linux> ,
it's a free operating system (OS) invented by Linus Torvald to
provide a UNIX-like system with all the standard
command-line and graphical tools that accompany
such a system.
=end para

=begin para
B<Linux> , rather than Windows or Mac, provides much of the
I<behind-the-scenes cloud> computing in data centers and
*high-performance computing facilities. It also powers the Android and
I<the > Internet of Things* (IoT).

=begin head2
Why Linux?
=end head2

=begin para
The command-line environment provides the user with almost complete
freedom to automate tasks typical in research or other work or study
in technical fields.
=end para

=begin para
B<Linux> also gives the user much greater control over what happens
and what does not happen on his or her computer.

Linux vs. Windows: Windows
=end head2

=begin para
Windows:
=end para

=item1 Is everywhere

=item1 Is primarily a GUI operation

=item1 Is expensive

=item1 B<Hides internals>

=item1 B<Has a non-case-sensitive file system>

=item1 Updates when Microsoft says it should, often restarting your

computer without your permission.

Linux vs. Windows: Linux
=end head2

=begin para
Linux:
=end para

=item1 Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

=item1 Is everywhere, although it is usually working behind the scenes

=item1 Has both GUI and intrinsic command line capabilities

=item1 B<Is FREE>

=item1 Shows as much or as little of the internals as you want to see

=item1 Has a case-sensitive file system

=item1 B<Performs upgrades only if you want it to>

=item1 Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,

"programmable calculator"

Linux: How to get it
=end head2

=begin para
On Windows or Mac:
=end para

=item1 Use B<Putty> to connect to a cloud server (as cheap as $2.50 per month)

=item1 Install the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem

=item1 Use a live, bootable USB [recommended for intro]

=item1 Use a live, bootable CD/DVD [only as a last resort]

=begin head2
Linux: How to get it
=end head2

=item1 Install Linux as a VM guest on Windows 10 Pro Hyper-V

=item1 Install VirtualBox to run a Linux Virtual Machine

=item1 Use I<Cygwin> on Windows

=begin para
Best:
=end para

=item1 Use a dual-boot, native installation

=item1 Use Hyper-V on Windows 10 Pro

=item1 Use a dedicated GNU/Linux PC or laptop

=begin head2
Linux comes in many "flavors"
=end head2

=begin para
A Linux system comes packaged in many B<distributions> such as
Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others.
=end para

=begin para
See <**<https://distrowatch.com>**> for lots of information about
popularity, download statistics, and other stats on hundreds of
B<distros> .
=end para

=begin para
We think I<Linux Mint> is one of the best I<distros> for beginners. I
prefer I<Debian> and have used it for over ten years
=end para

=begin head2
Linux help?
=end head2

=begin para
There is practically an infinite amount of Linux resources to be found
on the Internet.
=end para

=begin para
My group, the Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG), meets
monthly, and we have an installation meeting (by appointment only) on
the third Monday of every month.
