NAME
====

**Slidemaker** - Provides classes and routines for generating PDF slides from Rakudoc input.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Slidemaker;
$ create-slides <rakudoc file>
$ See file 'MyBriefing.pdf'
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Slidemaker** provides a system to create a PDF slide deck from a Rakudoc description. Following is a short example of such a description:

    =begin pod
    =slide
    =title Why Linux?
    =subtitle Introduction
    =author Joey Marshal
    =date 2024-05-10
    =item It's good for you.
    =item It's fun, too!
    =slide
    =title2 Why Linux?
    =subtitle
    =subtitle That's all folks!
    =end pod

Currently, the input document satisfies a basic need for a quick, text-based briefing presentation. It can provide:

  * Letter or A4 paper in landscape orientation

  * text

  * images

  * links

  * colored borders

  * colored text boxes (or frames)

  * a default theme

  * a YAML configuration file for a theme

An example theme configuration:

Run `$?` to download the example file from './resources'.
