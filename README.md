NAME
====

**Slidemaker** - Provides routines for generating PDF slides from Rakudoc input.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Slidemaker;
$ parse-slides <rakudoc file>
$ See file 'MyBriefing.pdf'
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Slidemaker** provides a system to create a PDF slide deck from a Rakudoc description. Following is an example of such a description:

    =begin pod

    =begin comment
        Config blocks apply to the entire document
        until the first slide. Then each slide can
        have its own Config blocks. See details for 
        defaults and recognized key/value pairs.
    =end comment

    =for Config :paper<letter> :title-bar-color<blue> :title-bar-height<1>
    = :dimensions<in>
    = :font<serif> :title-font-size<> :subtitle-font-size<> :font-size<>
    = :margins<1> 

    =begin comment
        A '=slide' starts a new slide and subsequent Config entries
        are constrained to the current slide.
    =end comment

    =slide 
    =Title Why Linux?
    =Subtitle Introduction to the Windows/Mac alternative
    =author Joey Marshal
    =date 2024-05-10
    =item It's good for you.
    =item It's fun, too!

    =slide 
    =Title Why Linux?
    =Subtitle That's all folks!
    =comment document definition is complete

    =end pod

Currently, the input document satisfies a basic need for a quick, text-based briefing presentation. It can provide:

  * Letter or A4 paper in landscape orientation

  * text

  * images

  * links

  * colored borders

  * colored text boxes (or frames)

Run `$ create-slides eg` to download the example file from './resources'.
